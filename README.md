# How to
I am following guides to get me going on this, with zero prior experience.

1. [Setup Skeleton](https://www.skeleton.dev/docs/get-started)
2. [Follow this Svelte guide to learn how it works and also add markdown functionality](https://joshcollinsworth.com/blog/build-static-sveltekit-markdown-blog)
3. [Next step, sort out styling my markdown with tailwind documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first)

Page is now published, using this framework.

Now to just populate it with more articles.
